I have two cute black kitten and i missed them :(  
**NOTE : I love cats!!! Especially black cats!!! BLACK CATS ARE NOT BAD LUCK! :)**

Things that 2022 has taught me : "it is what it is, people come and go and that's life."

#### What I am doing right now :

1. Studying to get a good grade 📚🎓!!!
2. Playing "[A Little To The Left](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1629520/A_Little_to_the_Left/)"
