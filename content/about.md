    <h2>Self-intro 😶‍🌫️</h2>
    <p>
    Hii, Sok Ling here. A year 2 student of Accounting & Finance. Living my life to the fullest, loving myself and healing at the moment. Carpe Diem~ I'm not disappearing, but I might need to take some time to find myself cuz i'm lost asf right now, please no more emotional attachment or just any random attachment. "Grow up" is a bad term for me, because that means I have to experience hurting, losing and grief to get lessons in life, but you know what is cruel? YOU HAVE TO GROW UP EVENTUALLY~

* ironocally, i hate smile this word :) how can i smile again?

Things that 2022 has taught me : "it is what it is, people come and go and that's life."  
Things I figured out in 2023 " "Stop being so desperate, learn to accept and change"

###### "Stop complaining about how miserable your life is if you're okay with being miserable"
