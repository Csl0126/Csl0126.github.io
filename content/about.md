    <h2>Self-intro 😶‍🌫️</h2>
    <p>
    Hello hoomans, I'm Sok Ling! (People also call me "CSL") I was born in 01 and currently pursuing an external degree of UOL in BSc Accounting & Finance (Year 2 now) in Help Academy, Malaysia. I enjoy listening to the music when I study and I usually like to take photo of nice views and good foods. I was once an athlete, I used to play 🏀 and represent the my state :) I'm learning make-up, learning about investments, learning about how to cook and trying to maintain a healthy lifestyle🤪. I created this website just wanted to post random things, memories as part of my life! I'm living my life to the fullest and loving myself❤️‍🩹. If you're reading to my intro right now, i wish you all the best in life and continue to explore my website hehehe💫. Cheers!

I have two cute black kitten and i missed them :(  
**NOTE : I love cats!!! Especially black cats!!! BLACK CATS ARE NOT BAD LUCK! :)**

\*\* I cut off with a lot of fair-weather friends, cleaned my circles and continue living my life. Things that 2022 has taught me : "it is what it is, people come and go and that's life."

#### What I am doing right now :

1. Studying to get a good grade 📚🎓!!!
2. Playing "[A Little To The Left](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1629520/A_Little_to_the_Left/)"
3. Learning about stocks 📈
