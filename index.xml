(People also call me "CSL") I was born in 01 and currently pursuing an external degree of UOL in BSc Accounting &amp; Finance (Year 2 now) in Help Academy, Malaysia. I enjoy listening to the music when I study and I usually like to take photo of nice views and good foods. I was once an athlete, I used to play 🏀 and represent the my state :) I'm learning make-up, learning about investments, learning about how to cook and trying to maintain a healthy lifestyle🤪.</description></item></channel></rss>
