A year 2 student of Accounting &amp; Finance. Living my life to the fullest, loving myself and healing at the moment. Carpe Diem~ I'm not disappearing, but I might need to take some time to find myself cuz i'm lost asf right now, please no more emotional attachment or just any random attachment. "Grow up" is a bad term for me, because that means I have to experience hurting, losing and grief to get lessons in life, but you know what is cruel?</description></item></channel></rss>
